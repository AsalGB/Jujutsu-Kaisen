                         <h2>Plot:</h2>
                         <p>Hardship, regret, shame: the negative feelings that humans feel become curses that lurk in our everyday lives. Curses run rampant throughout the world, capable of leading people to terrible misfortune and even death. What's more, the curses can only be exorcised by another curse.
                            Yuji Itadori is a boy with tremendous physical strength, though he lives a completely ordinary high school life. One day, to save a friend who has been attacked by cursed spirits, he eats the finger of Sukuna, taking the curse into his own soul. From then on, he shares one body with the King of Curses.  
                            Guided by the most powerful of jujutsu sorcerers, Satoru Gojo, Yuji is admitted to the Tokyo Jujutsu High School of Sorcery, an organization that exorcises the curses... and thus begins the heroic tale of a boy who became a curse to fight curses, a life from which he could never turn back</p>
