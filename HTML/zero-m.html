        <blockquote> <p>Yuta Okkotsu is haunted by the spirit of his childhood friend Rika, who died in a tragic traffic accident. Her spirit no longer appears as the sweet girl he called his beloved. Instead, her spirit has been cursed and she manifests as a monstrous entity who protects him against his will.-
            Unable to control Rika's immense power, Yuta is helpless to stop the bloodshed caused by his curse. As a result, Yuta is apprehended by Jujutsu Sorcerers, secret guardians of the world who are trained to combat Cursed Spirits like Rika. Yuta wishes to die in complete isolation so no one else can get hurt, but Satoru Gojo offers him a different path.
            Gojo has Yuta join Jujutsu High, where he studies with other sorcerers in training in order to control Rika in hopes of helping other people. Now a first-year, Yuta learns Jujutsu and combat arts alongside his new peers: Maki Zenin, a Cursed Tools user, Toge Inumaki, a Cursed Speech user, and Panda, a seemingly talking panda bear.
            Thanks to connections made with friends and finding his place at Jujutsu High, Yuta begins to gain the confidence to feel alive. He even begins to become comfortable with his abilities. However, as the training progresses Yuta learns that the dangers of the Jujutsu World go far beyond that of evil spirits.</p> </blockquote>
